So hey guys, my name is Borat.
Today I'll be talking about something that I've been working on for the past, let's say, six months or so.
To give a bit of a background, I started first in a big block sort of camp and then got introduced later to Liquid.
And I did some covenant R&D on Liquid for about two years, and now I'm recently exploring the Lightning space for about a year.
And as someone who initially comes sort of from that sort of big block camp, I've always had objections towards lightning, mainly around the UX, from backups to interactivity to liquidity problems.
I've had severe objections.
A few months ago, I tried to sort of working on a new light and more to address these problems.
And I've come to realization that these objections, the objections that I had in the past, they're all addressable in the long run.
